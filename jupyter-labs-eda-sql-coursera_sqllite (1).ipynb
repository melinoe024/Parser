    "SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.\n",
    "SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. \n",

    "This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.\n",
